Contributing translations
*************************

For translators we have a `Transifex account
<https://www.transifex.com/divio/django-cms/>`_ where you can translate
the ``.po`` files and don't need to install Git or Mercurial to be able to
contribute. All changes there will be automatically sent to the project.
